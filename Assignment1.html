				<h3 class='header-3'>Example 1:</h3>
				<h4 class='header-4'>Virgin Airlines America</h4>
				<p><img src="1.1.jpg" width="725" height="425" alt="Virgin Airlines" longdesc="1.1.jpg" /></p>
                    <p>The Virgin Airlines America  website is superb when it comes to UI design. The website&rsquo;s purpose is to help users complete the process of booking flights and puts the user&rsquo;s interests  front and center. Booking  a flight can be tedious for many, but for Virgin  Airlines America it doesn&rsquo;t appear to be that difficult. Virgin Airlines America&rsquo;s website  interface vigorously uses (and is one  of the first websites to use this particular form of UI) user-centered  interface design, which can be extremely helpful in drawing attention  to the most important aspects of a website&rsquo;s topics and its subjects  such as booking a flight. By the  website&rsquo;s interface removing all the surrounding content, the user could immediately start the booking process. </p>
<p>Throughout the entire process of booking, the user was reminded of their selection  by a bar at the top of the screen showing  their current choices.  By keeping this information visible,  Virgin made it easy for users to constantly see and edit their choices  instead of relying  on them to recall the information themselves. The website&rsquo;s UI was clearly designed to ensure  that a user can focus on completing their goal as quickly and efficiently as possible.                    </p>
<p>Virgin also made sure to stand out visually from the  competition. The use of bright colors, gradients, and fun illustrations created  a unique brand personality and experience that sets them apart from other competitors&rsquo; websites.

				<h4 class='header-4'>Airbnb</h4>
				<p><img src="1.2.jpg" width="725" height="425" alt="Airbnb" longdesc="1.2.jpg" /></p>
				<p>The Airbnb website strives for friendliness  when it comes to its UI design. Airbnb is an online marketplace for lodging,  primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities, mainly for  short-term affairs, but they could be longer, should the user decide to stay at  someplace for a while. The UI of Airbnb does two things extremely well: booking a place to stay, and creating  trust between two complete strangers. </p>
<p>Airbnb, much like Virgin Airlines  America, has prioritized making it easy to start booking  a stay right from the  home screen. Paired with its characteristic use of conversational copy, such as the &ldquo;What can we help you find, Edward?&rdquo; below,  and helpful cue text,  a user is simultaneously and courteously <em>invited and directed </em>to start planning their stay. </p>
                  <p>This conversational invite to start searching  is a delightful way of portraying the voice of the brand, as well as making the process of finding a place to stay simple. The only fields you need to specify during this initial  search are: choosing  a destination users would like to go, along with the duration of their stay and the number of guests. By leaving out the additional filters until the next step, the  process is streamlined, friendly  and approachable. </p>
<p>The listing pages are complete with a description of any additional fees that may be  included. This is a very straightforward, easy process for just about any user. </p>
                <p>After a user has requested  to book a location, they are taken to a new checkout page. The listing, pricing  and booking information sits to the right of the page to reduce  the need for the guest to retain the information from the previous page. </p>
                <p>Instead of getting right into the payment, the page prompts  you to &ldquo;say hello to your host and tell them why you&rsquo;re coming&rdquo;. By placing this prior to the  payment information, it starts  a conversation and connection between the guest and  host, and further invests the user in the experience. <strong>Airbnb takes pride in bringing people together and gives the conversation importance over the transaction â€“ the UI reflects this perfectly.</strong></p>
Airbnb has cleverly  thought out its copy  and used engaging  photos and videos to  ensure that the interface conveys an emotional tone that helps create a sense  of trust between strangers.                </div>

				<h2 class='header-2'>Examples of Bad User Interface Design</h2>
				<div class='assignment-examples'>
				<h3 class='header-3'>Example 1:</h3>
				<h4 class='header-4'>007 Museum</h4>
				<p><img src="2.1.jpg" width="725" height="555" alt="007 Museum" longdesc="2.1.jpg" /></p>
				<p>The 007 museum in Sweden  is the only museum dedicated to the James Bond franchise; however, the layout of this website is really bland and obsolete to modern UI design standards. The  entire layout of the  website consists of over-sized images and  font, all of it placed  in a disjointed way that doesn&rsquo;t  help guide the eye, with some images being centered, some  fixed to the left. It  looks like the website was designed during the stone ages of the internet (the late 80's/early 90's, of course!) and  lacks any kind of hierarchy in  its information architecture; however, it does provide the user quite some humor as  they  scroll down through  the  pages. After analysing the UI of this website, I would suggest to the developers of the website to make the UI not so out-of-place and hard to read for users if the 007 Museum wants to move outside the list of the most notorious UI designs in world history.</p>
				<h3 class='header-3'>Example 2:</h3>
				<h4 class='header-4'>MGBD Parts and Services</h4>
				<p><img src="2.2.jpg" width="725" height="568" alt="MGBD Parts and Services" longdesc="2.2.jpg" /></p>
				<p>This website is about selling, buying, and  servicing vintage cars and parts; however, its website&rsquo;s UI design  is terrible and archaic for modern UI design standards.                </p>
				<p>MDGB Parts  and Services has a homepage that greets  the  user with an outrageous 90's medley of  moving text, red font  that  isn&rsquo;t for error  message, and unclickable links (like to where the user wouldn&rsquo;t know whether they&rsquo;re links or not.  Whenever developers hyperlink a line of text, ALWAYS underline it and apply the  necessary formatting to the hyperlink so that users know that it is, indeed, a  link.). </p>
                <p>The main menu on the left side of the screen  is a series of duplicated images  (with  the options written in red  text). The only semblance of  hierarchical navigation in this  bad UI design  is that some of the menu options  are  aligned to the right. The  copy also keeps  it old-school throughout  the site with links like  &ldquo;click here&rdquo; and &ldquo;email here&rdquo;.                </p>
                <p> After analyzing the UI of this website, I would suggest to the devlopers of the website to make the UI not so out-of-place, hard to read, atrocious, and really confusing if they're willing to clean up the site substantially in order for users to navtigate through that website like driving a vehicle on a multi-lane freeway with little traffic. Also, the developers of the site need to make sure that they're formating text appropriately in order for end users to know wether an element on the site is clickable.</p>
